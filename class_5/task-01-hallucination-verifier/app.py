    This tool uses a multi-step verification process to detect potential hallucinations in AI responses.
    
    **How it works:**
    1. Gets an initial answer using Chain of Thought reasoning
    2. Requests sources for the answer
    3. Verifies the answer against the provided sources
    4. Provides a confidence score and detailed reasoning
    
    **Try these examples:**
    - "What is the capital of France?" (should be accurate)
    - "Who was the first person to walk on Mars?" (should be detected as hallucination)
    - "What is the largest planet in our solar system?" (should be accurate)
